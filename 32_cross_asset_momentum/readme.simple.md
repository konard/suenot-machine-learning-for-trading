# Cross-Asset Momentum: A Beginner's Guide

## What is Momentum? (In Simple Words)

Imagine you're riding a sled down a hill. Once the sled starts moving downhill, it picks up speed and keeps going by inertia. That's **momentum** — the tendency to keep moving in the same direction.

The same thing happens in financial markets:
- If an asset's price (cryptocurrency, stock) is rising, it often continues to rise
- If the price is falling, it often continues to fall

> **Real-life analogy:** Think of a popular song on the charts. If it's already at the top, more people will listen to it, and it stays popular. That's like momentum — success attracts success!

## Why Does This Work?

### Reason 1: People React Slowly

Imagine a new cool phone appears at school. First, 2-3 people buy it. Then a few more see it and want one too. A month later — half the class has it.

The same thing happens in markets:
- Good news comes out about Bitcoin
- First, only those who follow news buy
- Then their friends see the growth and buy too
- Then even more people join in

This is called **slow reaction** — information spreads gradually.

### Reason 2: The Crowd Effect

Remember how everyone runs to the cafeteria at recess? The first ones ran, others thought "must be something good" and ran too.

In markets:
- People see Bitcoin is rising
- They think "if everyone's buying, they must know something"
- They buy too
- The price rises even more

## Two Types of Momentum

### Type 1: Comparing to Itself (Time-Series)

It's like comparing your grades to last quarter:

```
Question: "Am I doing better than last month?"
- Yes → keep going (buy)
- No → something's wrong, slow down (don't buy)
```

**Example:**
- Bitcoin was $40,000 a month ago
- Now it's $45,000
- It grew! Momentum is positive → buy

### Type 2: Comparing to Others (Cross-Sectional)

It's like a class ranking — who's best, who's worst:

```
Question: "Which cryptocurrencies grew the most?"
- Top 3 → buy (they're the best)
- Bottom 3 → don't buy or sell
```

**Example for the last month:**
| Cryptocurrency | Growth | Rank |
|----------------|--------|------|
| Solana | +40% | 1 (buy!) |
| Ethereum | +25% | 2 (buy!) |
| Bitcoin | +15% | 3 (buy!) |
| Cardano | +5% | 4 |
| XRP | -10% | 5 (don't buy) |

## Dual Momentum: Best of Both Worlds

Now for the interesting part! We can combine both approaches:

**Step 1:** Check if the asset is growing at all (Time-Series)
**Step 2:** From those growing, pick the best (Cross-Sectional)

> **Analogy:** Imagine picking a team for soccer.
> - First, eliminate those who are sick or injured (can't play = not growing)
> - From the healthy ones, pick the strongest players

```
Cryptocurrency  | Growing? | How much? | Pick?
----------------|----------|-----------|------
Solana          | Yes      | +40%      | YES!
Ethereum        | Yes      | +25%      | YES!
Bitcoin         | Yes      | +15%      | YES!
Cardano         | No       | -5%       | NO
XRP             | No       | -10%      | NO
```

## Why Do This? Protection from Crashes!

The coolest thing about this strategy — it protects from big losses.

> **Umbrella analogy:** Imagine you have a magic umbrella. When it's sunny — you walk and tan. When it starts raining — the umbrella opens automatically and protects you.

**How it works:**
- Market is rising → we invest and earn
- Market starts falling → momentum becomes negative
- We sell and "hide" in cash (stablecoins)
- When market rises again → we return

**Example with Crypto Winter 2022:**

| Strategy | Losses |
|----------|--------|
| Just hold Bitcoin | -75% (ouch!) |
| Dual Momentum | -25% (manageable) |

The difference is huge! It's like the difference between "lost almost everything" and "lost a bit, but will recover".

## Risk Management: Don't Put All Eggs in One Basket

Another important rule — **volatility** (how much the price jumps around).

> **Swing analogy:** There are swings that move a little (safe). And there are swings that move a lot (scary, might fall off).

Cryptocurrencies are "wild swings". So:

```
Regular stocks:  buy at 100%
Cryptocurrencies: buy only at 30-50% (rest in cash)
```

The more an asset "swings", the less money we put into it.

## Example Strategy with Real Data

Let's say we have $1000 to invest in cryptocurrencies:

**Week 1: Analysis**
```
Bitcoin:   +10% growth for the month  → Positive momentum
Ethereum:  +15% growth for the month  → Positive momentum
Solana:    +25% growth for the month  → Positive momentum (best!)
XRP:       -5% drop                   → Negative momentum (skip)
```

**Money distribution:**
- Solana: $400 (best momentum)
- Ethereum: $350
- Bitcoin: $250
- XRP: $0 (negative momentum)

**Week 5: Check and Rebalance**
```
Bitcoin:   now +20%         → Improved!
Ethereum:  now +10%         → Got worse
Solana:    now -10%         → Became negative!
XRP:       now +5%          → Became positive
```

**New distribution:**
- Bitcoin: $450 (now the best)
- XRP: $350 (back in the game)
- Ethereum: $200
- Solana: $0 (sold, went negative)

## When to Check and Update?

```
For cryptocurrencies:
├── Check every week (Sunday evening)
├── Or daily (if you want to be more active)
└── Trade only if changes are significant (>10%)
```

> **Homework analogy:** You don't need to check grades every 5 minutes. It's enough to look at your report card once a week and see what needs work.

## What to Remember?

### Three Main Rules:

1. **Trend is Your Friend**
   - Buy what's rising
   - Sell what's falling
   - Don't try to guess reversals

2. **Pick the Best**
   - Not all rising assets are equal
   - Choose top 3 from the rising ones

3. **Protect from Crashes**
   - If everything's falling — go to cash
   - Better to miss growth than lose money

### Formula for Success:

```
Good strategy =
    Momentum (follow the trend)
  + Diversification (don't put everything in one basket)
  + Protection (go to cash during crashes)
  + Discipline (follow rules, not emotions)
```

## How to Try It Yourself?

### Step 1: Start with Paper Trading
Write down what you would buy/sell, but don't use real money.

### Step 2: Choose 5-10 Cryptocurrencies
Big and well-known: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.

### Step 3: Record Every Week
```
Date: ________
Cryptocurrency | Price a week ago | Price now | Change %
---------------|------------------|-----------|----------
BTC            | ___              | ___       | ___%
ETH            | ___              | ___       | ___%
...            | ...              | ...       | ...
```

### Step 4: Make Decisions
- Top 3 by growth → "buy"
- Falling → "sell" or "don't buy"

### Step 5: Check Results After a Month
Compare your "portfolio" to simple Buy & Hold Bitcoin.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Buying on the Dip
> "Bitcoin dropped 50%! It's cheap now, gotta buy!"

It's like catching a falling knife — you might cut yourself. Momentum strategy says: wait for the knife to fall and settle, then pick it up.

### Mistake 2: Not Taking Profits
> "Solana grew 100%! I'll hold longer!"

If momentum is reversing — sell. Don't get emotionally attached to an asset.

### Mistake 3: Trading Too Often
> "Bitcoin dropped 2% today! Selling immediately!"

Daily fluctuations are normal. Look at weekly or monthly trends.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Fees
> "I'll buy-sell every day!"

Each trade costs money. On Bybit it's 0.1%. If you trade 100 times a month — you give away 10% just in fees!

## Interesting Facts

1. **Momentum has worked for 200+ years** — there are studies showing its effectiveness even in the 1800s

2. **Works everywhere** — stocks, bonds, currencies, cryptocurrencies, even sports teams (wins attract wins!)

3. **Simple but effective** — many hedge funds use similar strategies

4. **Counter-intuitive** — seems like you should "buy low", but momentum says "buy what's already rising"

## Conclusion

Momentum strategy is not a magic "get rich" button. It's a disciplined approach to investing that:

- Helps avoid losing too much during crashes
- Makes you buy strong assets
- Removes emotions from trading

Start with paper trading, understand the principles, and only then move to real money. And remember — no strategy guarantees profit!
